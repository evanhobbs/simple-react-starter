## Simple React Boilerplate

A simple starter project for React (and other projects--just remove React). Starts a local server with livereload enabled and rebuilds automatically with Browserify and SASS. `.js` files can be JSX and make use of ES6 features thanks to Babel.

## To start

1. Clone or copy the repo.
2. From the directory run `npm install` to get all the dependencies.
3. Now do `npm start` or `gulp dev` to start the dev server and build system.
4. Open the project in the browser `http://localhost:8080/index.html`.

Note: make sure you have livereload installed and enabled for your browser.
